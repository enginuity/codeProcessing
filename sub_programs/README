Status of files: 
gen_code_dependencies.R - not updated (from netcomp)
generate_documenation.R - not updated (from sdfb)
generate_file_dependencies.R - not updated (from sdfb)
generate_todo_list.R - updated, needs improvement
search_code.R - works in new framework
text_proc_fxs.R - general helper functions - bunch of functions pasted; needs cleanup

Ideas: 
--Code file annotation (basically like search_code, but a bit more powerful), to look for certain features (badly formatted code? etc.)
--Automatic README file generation (based on generate_documentation; as is, is not very useful since it will create a huge file in one place, while having folder-separated documentation would be better.
