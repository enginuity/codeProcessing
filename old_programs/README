Status of files: 
generate_documenation.R - not updated (from sdfb)
generate_file_dependencies.R - not updated (from sdfb)
OLD_gen_depend_C.R - just gen_depend_C function. not updated since sdfb. 
OLD_create_roxygen_comments.R -- old stuff related to parameter editing. 

h_find_enclosed_text.R -- Old code that essentially finds stuff inside of a set of parenthesis... mainly used for parsing the parameters of a function. Now that the 'parse' function is used to do this easily, this code is unneeded... thus moved here. Maybe someday this might be used to parse the exact length of a function or something...
