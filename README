General Description of Project: 

WARNING: DO NOT RUN THIS CODE ON ANY DIRECTORY WITHOUT VERSION CONTROL... [maybe a check to look for [.git] folders or something might be implemented someday]

This R package (set of tools/functions) can be thought of as developer tools for R, in the sense that it will help in making your code more structured or improve the efficiency of coding.

The current functional parts are the following: 

-- generate a todo report :: This simply searches the code for possible 'TODO::' style comments, and generates a report of such comments

-- search/replace/comment text :: It's possible to search an entire directory/set of files for any text and do any/all of the following
---- Replace text with other text
---- Add a comment on the next line
---- Generate a report denoting where all of the matches were found

-- create a color-coded (coded by file) function dependency tree/graph :: It's possible to extract all the named functions in an R package/set of source files, and create a dependency network/graph between them (which functions calls (depends on) other functions). 

-- create Roxygen2 style documentation templates :: It's possible to run a function that creates Roxygen2 templates (including inserting templates for each parameter in the function), to save a tiny bit of typing. It also has a few more functionalities such as: 
---- Insert/replace the same documentation for the same named parameter in multiple functions
---- Automatically reorder parameter documentations if parameters are reordered in the function


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version Plan: 
Current version: 0.1.2

Version 0.1.3 -- fix dependency plotting
Version 0.1.4 -- improve documentation processing
Version 0.1.5 -- improve dependency plotting

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package documentation rules: 

Documentation rules -- For parameter listings in function documentation: 
[<type>] :: <documentation>
, will separate information about parameters: eg. 
LEN = (length of vector) or 
DIM = (dimensions of matrix, etc.)
; will separate information about values the parameter takes on
DEFAULT = (default value) or
ALLOWED = (possibly a vector of allowed values)

Example: 
[vector-int, LEN = 2; DEFAULT = c(1,2)] :: some description

For documentation of classes: (S3 classes)
an \itemize with items as follows: 
\item <name> -- [<mode description as above>] :: <documentation>
