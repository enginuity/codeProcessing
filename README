General Description of Project: 

This R package will contain a set of functions that can be thought of as developer tools for R, in the sense that it will make your coding either more efficient or more structured. 

NOTE OF WARNING: DO NOT RUN THIS CODE ON ANY DIRECTORY WITHOUT VERSION CONTROL... [maybe a check could be performed to look for [.git] folders or something]

Things to think about for collaboration: 
I guess some research should be done to see of these things exist... I've done some, but I've not found a good solution, though I guess that doesn't mean one doesn't exist. This doesn't really matter if we don't plan to publish the package, but if that's part of the plan, this is really important. 

We'll need a version map (plan) and a versioning system. Think about this later. 

We'll need a good way to do version control properly. (use of branches? etc.)

We'll need code conventions: 
-- maybe? think about this. THis has not been implemented yet. Only care about this 
Functions starting with upper-case letter => typically only helper functions
Functions starting with lower-case letters => intended to be called from outside

etc.. probably lots more issues, but we can discuss.
