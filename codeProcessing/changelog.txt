version 0.1.1 2015/03/02
- remove DEFAULT_FD behavior -- now, if FD is NULL, default to working directory
--- FUTURE WORK - need to safeguard working directory. (check for .git repository?! or other version control)
- remove the need to call library(stringr); made all calls to package (i think) use the namespace, and added stringr as an import.
